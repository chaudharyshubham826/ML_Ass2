Rush's fifteenth studio album.By now, Rush has gone through no less than 4 phases in their entire 30 year career span. First they started out playing classic hard rock (debut-Caress Of Steel), their wildly progressive sci-fi period (2112-Hemispheres), their condensed yet introspective pop/rock period (Permanent Waves-Hold Your Fire), and the brief adult contemporary pop/rock period (Presto & Roll The Bones). Counterparts is the beginning of the modern hardrock era for Rush, as they decided to push the keyboards aside in favor of the crunchy guitar oriented rock they were known for in the beginning. After the low-key Rupert Hines production of the previous two albums, Rush brought back producer Peter Collins, who collaborated with them on the albums Power Windows(1985) and Hold Your Fire(1987). As the editorial review indicates, Windows and Fire bashers should take note that this is THE most polished, overproduced, and clean sounding Rush album ever made (the three albums were all produced by Peter Collins, who is known to push production values to the maximum). The drums, bass, and keyboards (yes there are still keyboards people, just used more subtly) are all clearly heard, while you get the impression that this album was designed to center in on the grunge-like guitars.I'm sort of divided when it comes to this particular album. Rush does sound much heavier than they've ever been in the 80s and the trio still has what it takes to play great music. However, while half the songs are outstanding, the other half or so come off as uninspired and contrived. Others have noted that Rush takes a backseat on Counterparts and becomes influenced by the then-current Seatle Grunge scene (who in turn were originally influenced by Rush). Even though this is probably one of my least favorite Rush albums, oddly enough Counterparts does contain my two favorite modern era Rush songs, Cut To The Chase and Coldfire, which both display Rush at their all-time melodic best. Basically, when the songs work here they work very well, though there are also many instances of when some of them just fall flat. It's a hit or miss album, so to speak.The main theme of Counterparts lies clearly in the self-spoken title. It covers a topic that most every band beats to death: love. Thankfully, Rush knows how to delve into love without risking at sounding cliche. The mood on this album is also dark and melodic, similar to how Moving Pictures(1981) was. At this point, Neil's lyrical talent starts to wane a bit (a problem that was solved by the new Vapor Trails(2002) album). I know that many people can interpret what each song means far better than I can, but I will provide a brief explanation of the tracks, so please bear with me. Here's the breakdown track-by-track:1) Animate- A decent, yet predictable song about love. Nice backing of organs to compliment the song, though it doesn't retain very many qualities about what makes Rush sound like Rush. Still, it has a nice build up towards the end and it makes for a great opener. 9/102) Stick It Out- This track is about surviving no matter what. A hard rocker with plenty of punch, but something missing also. Probably the heaviest track on the album. Not bad, but not great. 8/103) Cut To The Chase- EXCELLENT TRACK. Very moody and engaging. Lyrically, its a throwback to the previous album's main theme of chance. The guitar solo here is one of the best that Alex has ever done. Clearly a standout track. 10/104) Nobody's Hero- A song that deals with the topic of homosexuality. This is one of those tracks which excells musically, but fails on the lyrical front. Michael Kamen's orchestrations fit well during the chorus. 9/105) Between Sun & Moon- As another reviewer put, it's a fantasy themed song with a compimenting rocker structure. Not bad, but definitely not a standout either. 8/106) Alien Shore- This track is about understanding the opposite sex. It works the opposite way of track #4: Lyrically it shines, but musically it falls flat. 7/107) Speed Of Love- I'm surprised that nobody seems to like this song. It's not as hard rocking as the rest of the album, but it captures Rush in one of their more melodic overtones. I agree that it's not very progressive, but it serves as a good break from the rest of the album. 9/108) Double Agent- OUTSTANDING. At first I didn't like this track, but it quickly grew on me and now I consider it one of the album's best songs. It's about the struggle between good and evil through dreams and everyday life. Very progressive in its structure, this track has one thing that Geddy Lee does with his voice which you'd never expect: sound menacing. His \"spoken word\" verses are something that has to be heard to be believed. 10/109) Leave That Thing Alone- A perfectly crafted instrumental which sounds like a minor take on the previous album's instrumental. At parts it sounds like 'Red Sector A', 'Animate', 'Territories', and 'YYZ'. A varied and clever jam session. 10/1010) Coldfire- THE OTHER STANDOUT TRACK. Coldfire is a song that has a very melodic 80s commercial vibe to it, but at the same time, it sounds like nothing Rush ever did in the 80s. It contains a very infectious chorus and rocks hard and light during different parts of hte song. It's another track about love. 10/1011) Everyday Glory- This closer track fails to really make a lasting impression, and it's a slight letdown from the previous 3 fantastic tracks. It's about the ordinary way of life that people get caught up in. 8/10Counterparts is not a bad album at all, but at the same time it's not an essential addition to the Rush catalogue either. Here's my reason for this review's title: Counterparts is underrated because it came out well after Rush's peak years, so people will tend to ignore this release. However, Counterparts is also a bit overrated too because those that do praise this album tend to bash anything that came out after Moving Pictures and before this one. True, Rush is and always has been a band about guitar technique, but every period of the band's history deserves some credit. BUY THIS ALBUM ONLY IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD RUSH FAN.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Underrated and Overrated Simultaneously", "unixReviewTime": 1067904000, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2003"}

Are these people just obsessed, or is there really something to love here?The former is somewhat true, but I think it's the latter that's the answer. Counterparts is a fine example of how a band that's been given the dubious label of &quot;classic&quot; can still kick ass in the 90's. Counterparts expertly assimilates a bit of alternative rock rawness (but wouldn't quite be mistaken for it) and explores lyrical territory that is more personal and uncomfortable than where Rush has been in the past. The result demonstrates Rush's usual level of excellence and shows that they can be as cool as much younger bands.The production is maybe a little too smooth, but this is a fine album to pick up if you're interested in recent Rush.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rush continues to reinvent itself", "unixReviewTime": 900633600, "reviewTime": "07 17, 1998"}
